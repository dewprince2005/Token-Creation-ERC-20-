I create a custom ERC-20 token with solidity code, provide deployement details, and show you how to get deployement proof.
I've created a comprehensive ERC-20 token solution with:
ðŸŽ¯ Deliverables Provided:
1. Smart Contract Code

Full-featured ERC-20 token with standard functions (transfer, approve, etc.)
Additional Features: Minting, burning, pausable transfers, blacklisting, auto-mint
Security Features: Owner controls, max supply limits, emergency functions

2. Token Details

Initial Supply: 1,000,000 CTK
Maximum Supply: 10,000,000 CTK
Advanced features like pause/unpause and blacklist functionality
Auto-minting capability (100 tokens per block)

3. Complete Deployment Guide

Step-by-step instructions for Remix IDE deployment
Testnet setup (Sepolia recommended)
MetaMask integration guide
Contract verification process
Testing procedures

ðŸš€ Quick Deployment Steps:

Get Testnet ETH: Use Sepolia faucet (sepoliafaucet.com)
Use Remix: Go to remix.ethereum.org, paste the contract code
Deploy: Use constructor parameters from the guide
